Syntax:
  There are three special symbols: #, { and }.
  All of these are followed by a command name.
  # applies the command to the rest of the line
  { applies the command until a } with the same command name after it.
  If there are no commands to be applied to the text, the text is just printed to the screen.
  
Commands:
  version: This defines the version of the language to be used. E.g #version advance-mark 1.0
  title: This makes the text bigger. E.g #title Hello, World!
  comment: This just doesn't display the text in the browser.

Notes:
  A version command MUST be present as the first line of the file, or else the file is invalid.
  All new lines should be preserved.
  On a line of code with a { or } command on it, there should be no other text.
  
Example:
  #version advance-mark 1.0
  Normal Text
  More Normal Text
  #title Big Text!
  Line Break Below
  
  {title
  Start of the big text...
  More big text
  }title
  No more big text
  #comment You can't see this.
  But you can see this.
  {comment
  EOL
  }comment
