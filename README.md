# Easy Web Standards

Although HTML, CSS and Javascript may seem easy, for beginners, they are more difficult than needed and more wasteful of developers time.
The Easy Web Standards try to make alternatives to those languages which focus on four core things:

1. Simplicity: The languages should be really easy and simple to learn, while still being cable enough for most tasks. They are inspired by markdown.
2. Non-Intrusiveness: The languages should let you spend as much time as possible actually saying what you want to say, instead of typing commands and the like that the user will never notice.
3. Uniformity: Unlike HTML, CSS and Javascript, the languages should all have a similar style so if you learn one, it's easy to learn another.
4. Openness: The standards are licences under the copyleft GPLv3 License to ensure they continue to be open.

The HTML replacement is "AdvanceMark". You can find the specification in the AdvanceMark.md file.
The other replacements will be made soon.

Note: These standards documents will soon be ported to AdvanceMark.
